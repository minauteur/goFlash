# goFlash
A simple flashcard app written in Go and JS.
<br>
<br>
The project contains three files: 
<br>
<ul>
<li>  cardadd.html is a template containing HTML form elements feeding input to a data struct, allowing users to add their own flashcards to a deck.
<li>  main.html is another template containing the necessary Javascript for serving the user's custom cards on the front-end.
<li>  flash.go contains the back-end code for parsing the templates and serving the user's data as virtual flashcards.
</ul>
<br>
TODO:
<br>
<ul>
<li>  Add the ability to create, select, and serve multiple decks of cards.
<li>  Add user login/verification for maintaining separate decks on a "per-user" and/or "shared" basis.
</ul>
